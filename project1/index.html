      <h2>What Data Scientists Do</h2>
      <p>Data scientists turn raw data into useful information for decisions. The work involves collecting and cleaning datasets, exploring patterns, and building statistical and machine learning models to answer questions or make predictions.</p>
      <p>Projects often include classification, regression, clustering, forecasting, and recommendation tasks. Clear communication of results is also a core part of the role.</p>

      <h2>Using Data to Train Machines</h2>
      <p>Training machines means creating models that learn from examples. A dataset is split into training and testing sets. During training, the model adjusts internal parameters to reduce errors on the training data. The test set checks if the model generalizes to new data.</p>
      <p>Common tools include Python, R, SQL, and libraries for machine learning. Models can learn signals in financial data, detect spam, recognize images, and more.</p>
